Programming Challenge: Movie Aggregator  Part A:  Create a console-based application that accepts movie details like Name, Run Time, Language, Lead Actor and Genre and then export these details into one of the 2 formats, depending on user’s choice - “plain text” or “PDF”.  Part B:  Make the application extensible so that it is easy to “plug in” a new format and the application automatically has the capability to export to the new format without making any changes to the application code.
